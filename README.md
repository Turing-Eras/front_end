## About The Project

Eras is an application that allows users to live more intentionally by visualizing their life as a series of meaningful events.

Users can provide information about basic life events generated by a series of questions that will provide them with a visual display of their life. The ability to visualize your life as a series of events brings attention to the fleeting nature of our existence while also allowing for thoughtful reflection on how we choose to spend the time we have. Eras allows you to pursue your future in a more deliberate and meaningful way.

The deployed front end can be found [here](https://eras-frontend.herokuapp.com/) and receives queries and mutations from a custom-built [GraphQL on Rails API](https://eras-api.herokuapp.com/) which can be found [here](https://github.com/Turing-Eras/api).
